# Trees_Census_Dashboard

This project delves into a dataset focusing on tree plantations in and around New York City, which were carried out by Volunteers, Tree Count Staff, and NYC Parks Staff. With 45 variables, including stump size, sidewalk damage, and tree-related issues, exploratory data analysis was conducted using Tableau.

The Visualizations reveal that tree plantations are most common during the summer and fall seasons, with NYC Parks Staff and Trees Count Staff being the prominent user groups and showcases the distribution of tree plantations across different cities, indicating a direct relationship between area size and the number of trees planted. Additionally, we identified the top five tree species planted in the city and found exponential growth in tree plantations from January to December, indicating a gradual increase throughout the year. 

This project provides valuable insights for urban planners, environmental organizations, and policymakers, aiding in informed decision-making for urban greening and sustainable city planning initiatives in New York City.
